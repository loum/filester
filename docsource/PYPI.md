## Overview
[Filer](https://github.com/loum/filer) is a simple toolkit of common file based utilities that I
found re-using in all of my Python projects.  Basic tasks such as atomic file copy, move and delete that have been
tested and just work.

The complete list of file-based helpers can be found at [https://loum.github.io/filer/](https://loum.github.io/filer/)

## Installing from PyPI
```
pip install filer
```
